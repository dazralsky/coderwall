Hey Friend,

Creating a team page on Coderwall has some great advantages. Getting on the Team Leaderboard is a great way to show off your team’s geek cred and increase your visibility on Coderwall. Plus, members can stay up to date with teams by following them and receiving the team’s updates in their dashboard.

Starting your team page is simple:
1. reserve a team name
2. add your company logo
3. invite your team members

Plus, here are a few things we'll do to make your new team page better.
* grab your member's pro tips and put them on your page
* scan your member's profile to populate your skills
* assign your team a score to rank against others
* beautifully display all of your members

Voilà! You'll have a awesome page like Github and many others.
