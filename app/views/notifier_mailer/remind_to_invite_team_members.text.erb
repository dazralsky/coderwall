Hey Friend,

The <%= @user.team.name %> team page looks great. Have you invited your whole team to join yet? There are a lot of advantages to having all your team members on the <%= @user.team.name %> page.

1) More team members can lead to a higher score
Your team score is determined by each team member’s achievements, peer endorsements, speaking history, and then adjusted to the team’s central tendency.

2) Higher score = higher ranking on team leaderboard
The leaderboard is a fun way to showcase some of Coderwall’s most innovative and interesting teams. We know <%= @user.team.name %> is doing awesome things. With a higher team score, everyone else can know that, too.

3) Every team member counts
Github is currently in 1st place on the Team Leaderboard with 61 members while Groupon is ranked 22nd with 60 members. Who is the one teammate that will push <%= @user.team.name %> up the leaderboard?

To add team members, just share this private link: <%= invitation_url(@user.team.id, :r => CGI.escape(@user.referral_token)) %>
