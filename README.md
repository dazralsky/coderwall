Coderwall is built from the following open source components:

- [Backbone.js](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone)
- [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)
- [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)

Plus *lots* of Ruby Gems, a complete list of which is at [/master/Gemfile](https://github.com/assemblymade/coderwall/blob/master/Gemfile).
